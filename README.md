This is my final project for PLP bootcamp training which I enrolled in February 2024. I have been pursuing a certificate in Software Development with a 
specialization in Web Technologies.
This project is a Website for a company that deals with WEB DESIGNING.
For this project, I have used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT for front- end, and MYSQL plus NODE.JS for the backend.
I have also hosted the work on FIREBASE, VERCEL and NETLIFY.
